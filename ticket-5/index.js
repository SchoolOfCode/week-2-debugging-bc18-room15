// One of JavaScript's flexible behaviours is that accessing a non-existent property on an object simply evaluates to undefined. 
//However, this lenient behaviour does not apply when trying to access a property on an undefined or null value (instead JavaScript throws an error, which by default would cause the software to crash).


// typeof item shows 'undefined'
